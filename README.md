Final Project
Our project runs on two datasets, the airports dataset as well as the routes dataset.
There is nothing to be done in order to build the graph and its members. 

To run the project, run make and then run ./final on the next line.

Upon receiving the prompts to write down airports, please bear in mind that the input must be the 3-letter code given to each airport and must be all capitals.

In order to implement Landmark Path algorithm, a third prompt will be received to ask for the connecting airport. Following the same guidelines as above and taking the help of the airports printed by the BFS traversal on the terminal, you can input a third airport that acts as a connecting point.

To run our test cases, just run make test && ./test.
