Week 1 :
In the first week, we began researching different algorithms to utilize in our project. We also looked into the different datasets that we could operate on.

Week 2 :
We worked on the project proposal and shortlisted the algorithms we wanted to use : graph coloring, djikstra's algorithm and BFS. We also decided to use data from the list of Stanford datasets, specifically, the list of Stanford websites.  

Week 3 :
We began writing our foundational code for each algorithm and developing a skeleton for graph coloring and djikstra's.  

Week 4:
This week we made a large change to our project do to issues developing code for our previous algorithms and also application of said algorithms to our chosen dataset. As such, we decided to move away from a graph coloring algorithm and instead chose to implement a landmark algorithm. We also decided to use a new dataset, choosing from the OpenFlights, we now inteand to find the fastest way from point A to point B using our three algorithms. In terms of code made, we are able to read data from our data set, and have begun finalizing code for the BFS and Djikstra's algorithms to solve our problem, we hope to have those two fully working in the next couple days and spend the last week finishing the landmark algorithm.

Week 5: 
Created the interface and implementation for the graph data structure used to store the airports, city names, latitudes, longitudes as nodes and the distance between two airports/cities as the weights of the edges. Also created the BFS traversal algorithm for traversing the graph as well as a function to read in the dataset and construct the graph.
