Week 1 :
In the first week, we began researching different algorithms to utilize in our project. We also looked into the different datasets that we could operate on.

Week 2 :
We worked on the project proposal and shortlisted the algorithms we wanted to use : graph coloring, djikstra's algorithm and BFS. We also decided to use data from the list of Stanford datasets, specifically, the list of Stanford websites.  

Week 3 :
We began writing our foundational code for each algorithm and developing a skeleton for graph coloring and djikstra's.
